# landing-page
Landing project for the odin project. 

Brief: 
    The goal of this project is to create a webpage based of the design and aspects of the two images provided. 
    It does not need to be pixel perfect but does need to be original code with no peeking at other solutions. 
    Google is acceptable for learning how to do specific functions within the code however.
